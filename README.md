# PythonSearchProgram
New York Times Best Sellers sorting/searching program.

To run, be sure both the python program and the NYT-Bestsellers.txt files are in the same repository, then simply run the python program. The user is presented with 6 options to search by, and one by typing in the corresponding number and then pressing "Enter". For example, selecting option 3 and then entering the name "King" will provide the user all the authors in the Bestseller list whose name contains "King".
